# TidyEngine
TidyEngine is a game engine that was created for making games in a C++ framework. V0.2 moved away from SDL2 and instead uses GLFW for window and input handling. It also uses glew for fast modern OpenGL rendering.

# Features
- Full OpenGL support
- Fully cross-platform

# Build instructions
I really appreciate any help I can get. If you want to start contributing to this project you will need to be able to build the engine itself. Here is all the dependencies you need:

- GLFW, used for handling windows and the input.
- glew, used for OpenGL rendering.
- glm, used for math when rendering.

<h3>Linux Instructions</h3>
- Coming soon

<h3>Windows Instructions with Visual Studio</h3>
- Coming soon

# Presentation
