# TidyEngine
TidyEngine is a game engine utilizing C++14 and SDL2 to achieve excellent performance, while still being simple to use and to work with. The engine is well documented and written with clean code to make it easier to work in. This game engine is always being developed and new cool features are added to the engine all the time.

# Who is this game engine for?
TidyEngine is for programmers that want to make 2D games. This means that you will probably need C++ knowledge to be able to work with this engine. This engine was not made for designers or artists. Tools for this game engine is planned to make it easier for non C++ programmers but right now is not under development.

# Build instructions
I really appreciate any help I can get. If you want to start contributing to this project you will need to be able to build the engine itself. Here is all the dependencies you need:
-SDL2
-SDL2_image
-SDL2_ttf
-SDL2_mixer
-glm
