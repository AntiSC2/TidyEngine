# TidyEngine
TidyEngine is a game engine that I created for educational purposes. Feel free to use if you want.

# Who is this game engine for?
TidyEngine is for programmers that want to make 2D games. This means that you will probably need C++ knowledge to be able to work with this engine. This engine was not made for designers or artists.

# Build instructions
I really appreciate any help I can get. If you want to start contributing to this project you will need to be able to build the engine itself. Here is all the dependencies you need:
-SDL2
-SDL2_image
-SDL2_ttf
-SDL2_mixer
-glm

# Presentation
Here's a google slide presentation showing off the general map for this engine.
