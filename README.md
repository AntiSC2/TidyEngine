# TidyEngine
TidyEngine is a game engine that was created for making games in a C++ framework. V0.2 moved away from SDL2 and instead uses GLFW for window and input handling. It also uses glew for fast modern OpenGL rendering. When it comes to loading bitmaps, this project uses the FreeImage open source image library.

# Features
- Full OpenGL support
- Fully cross-platform

# Build instructions
I really appreciate any help I can get. If you want to start contributing to this project you will need to be able to build the engine itself. Here is all the dependencies you need:

- GLFW, used for handling windows and the input.
- glew, used for OpenGL rendering.
- glm, used for math when rendering.

<h3>Linux Instructions</h3>
- Coming soon

<h3>Windows Instructions with Visual Studio</h3>
- Coming soon
